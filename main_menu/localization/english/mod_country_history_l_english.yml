country_history_HES: "The [GetCountry('ENG').GetAdjective] crown is still reeling from the treacherous rebellion that occurred ten year prior and resulted in the underhanded assassination of [GetCharacter('eng_edward_ii').GetShortName]. Although the ringleaders were executed, several co-conspirators have been granted mercy in the name of peace — a peace which could easily be shattered at any moment.\n\nMeanwhile, [GetCharacter('eng_edward_ii').GetShortName]'s surviving heir, [GetCharacter('eng_edward_iii').GetShortName], has already proven to be a capable young ruler, and is making bold designs on the [GetCountry('FRA').GetAdjective] throne — a throne which is his birthright as the grandson of a [ShowDynastyName('capet_dynasty')] ruler.\n\nIn the north, the misguided [GetCountry('SBL').GetName] weakly contends for the [GetCountry('SCO').GetAdjective] crown, while our loyal vassals maintain a tight grip on the governments of [GetCountry('WLS').GetName], [GetCountry('PLE').GetName], and [GetCountry('AQN').GetName].\n\nHow shall we brave the turbulent years to come? Will we cross the channel and become a continental power, or should we look to the seas for global dominion?"
