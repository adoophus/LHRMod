flavor_hes.1.title: "The Landgrave Asserts His Authority"
flavor_hes.1.desc: "Our courts and chanceries are finally strong enough to mount a significant challenge to the autonomous powers within the Landgraviate. For generations, the power of our government has been constrained by entrenched privilege, whether by the feudal independence of the knightly class or the ancient fiscal exemptions claimed by the Church. Now, backed by capable administrators and lawyers, the Landgrave has the political opportunity to revoke one of these primary obstacles to true centralized rule."

# Historical Information linking the event to key struggles for centralization
flavor_hes.1.historical_info: "This period represents the Landgraves' long struggle for administrative unity. Following the ascension of Heinrich II, the powerful nobility regularly challenged the Landgrave's authority, demanding confirmation of their ancient rights and privileges. Conversely, the Landgraves repeatedly sought to curb the fiscal autonomy of the Church, viewing the tithe as revenue vital to the growing state."

# Option A: Revoke Noble Privilege (hesse_2: Castle Rights and Noble Exemption)
flavor_hes.1.a: "No more uncontrolled rights."
flavor_hes.1.a.tt1: "Demand payment from the nobility."

# Option B: Revoke Clergy Privilege (hesse_3: Tithe Control and Church Autonomy)
flavor_hes.1.b: "Foreign actors be damned."
flavor_hes.1.b.tt1: "Remove foreign influence over the clergy."

# Option C: Do Nothing
flavor_hes.1.c: "Let us proceed with caution."

flavor_hes.2.title: "The [ShowLocationName('korbach')] Bullion Flood"
flavor_hes.2.desc: "Our long-established mining operations in [ShowLocationName('korbach')], while immensely profitable, are beginning to critically destabilize the national economy. The constant, massive influx of bullion is fundamentally devaluing our coinage, causing runaway inflation and social instability as the cost of basic goods skyrockets. We must choose between fiscal prudence or immediate treasury needs as the economic chaos threatens to tear at the fabric of the Landgraviate."

# Historical Information linking the event to Korbach's economic challenge
flavor_hes.2.historical_info: "Mining in the region of Waldeck-Korbach, particularly for silver and gold, dates back to the 13th century and was crucial to the regional economy. However, the medieval system of coinage struggled to cope with a sudden, large increase in bullion supply. Rulers frequently debased coinage or seized private wealth to fund their wars, actions which invariably led to chronic inflation and massive social distress, as seen in numerous periods across the Holy Roman Empire."

# Option A: Stabilize (Gives high stability and inflation reduction)
flavor_hes.2.a: "Initiate a painful currency stabilization policy."

# Option B: Reckless Seizure (Gives high gold, massive stability loss)
flavor_hes.2.b: "Seize the flow of gold for the treasury, damn the consequences!"

flavor_hes.3.title: "The [ShowLocationName('marburg')] Charter"
flavor_hes.3.desc: "The settlement of [ShowLocationName('marburg')] has long been an important local center due to the abbey known as St. Elizabeth's Church. However, the growing population of burghers and surrounding peasants are now petitioning the Landgrave for a formal market charter, demanding to be recognized as a Town and be granted self-governance rights. The local clergy often resist the rise of independent towns that threaten their influence, however an opportunity to formalize infrastructure and boost regional trade should not be missed lightly."

flavor_hes.3.historical_info: "[ShowLocationName('marburg')], the former seat of the Landgraviate of Thuringia, held immense strategic and religious importance due to the Shrine of St. Elizabeth, making it a powerful center long before the Reformation. Its early development was often marked by friction between the established ecclesiastical authorities and the growing economic interests of the urban community. Formal recognition as a town was vital for securing political autonomy and trade routes."

# Option A: Promote Marburg (Mechanically: change_location_rank = location_rank:town)
flavor_hes.3.a: "Grant the charter and recognize [ShowLocationName('marburg')] as a Town."
flavor_hes.3.a.tt1: "The estates take on the majority of the cost"

# Option B: Maintain Status Quo (Mechanically: Do nothing)
flavor_hes.3.b: "Refuse the petition; the current feudal arrangement must be upheld!"

flavor_hes.4.title: "The Sternerbund Demands Concessions"
flavor_hes.4.desc: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetName] made attempts to centralize military administration and they have been met with fierce resistance from the most powerful noble families in the Ritterschaft. They have banded together in a dangerous coalition called the Sternerbund, presenting us with an ultimatum. We must either pay an enormous indemnity to secure their loyalty and reform their old feudal privileges, or face an open, coordinated rebellion designed to shatter the Landgraviate's fragile unity and preserve their independence."

flavor_hes.4.historical_info: "In the late 14th century, the Hessian nobility quickly consolidated their power, culminating in the 1370s with the formation of the Star League. This powerful coalition was designed to oppose the Landgrave's attempts at centralization and taxation. Confronting the League militarily proved disastrously expensive, often forcing the Landgraves to make crippling financial and political concessions to regain control."

# Option A: Historical Compromise/Reform
flavor_hes.4.a: "Pay the indemnity and reform the Noble's privileges."

flavor_hes.5.title: "Establishment of the Hofkanzlei"
flavor_hes.5.desc: "With the major crisis of the nobility now settled, the Landgrave must focus on building a permanent, loyal administrative structure. The current feudal system relies too heavily on local lords and external clerical courts. By funding and empowering a central **Hofkanzlei** (Court Chancery) in Kassel, we can bypass many entrenched local interests and ensure that the Landgrave's writ is executed consistently throughout the territory, albeit at a continuous investment cost."

flavor_hes.5.historical_info: "Under Landgrave Ludwig I (r. 1413-1458), Hesse made significant progress in judicial and administrative centralization. The establishment of the **Hofkanzlei** and the creation of a standing court were critical steps in transforming the Landgraviate from a fractured feudal entity into a more modern territorial state, able to effectively enforce its laws."

# Option A: Invest in long-term centralization

flavor_hes.6.title: "The Iron Chancellor: Gottfried von Beust"
flavor_hes.hes_hired_beust: "Chancellor Gottfried von Beust Retained"
flavor_hes.6.desc: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetName] requires absolute loyalty and competence to manage his continuous feuds and massive debts. [target_character.GetName], a stern and unyielding cleric, has served as a pivotal figure in the Hofkanzlei. Known for his austere methods, he is uniquely capable of managing the state's chaotic finances and consolidating records. However, the methods of [target_character.GetShortName] are unpopular, and retaining him means relying heavily on the clerical estate for administration."
flavor_hes.6.historical_info: "Gottfried von Beust served [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetName] during the turbulent middle of his reign (c. 1340s-1360s). As Chancellor, he was responsible for running the Landgrave's central administration, ensuring the state functioned despite Heinrich's near-constant involvement in costly feuds and military expenditures. The ability of medieval princes to centralize power rested heavily on the competence and loyalty of such chief administrators."
flavor_hes.6.a: "Make [target_character.GetLastName] one of our chief advisors."

flavor_hes.7.title: "The Iron Chancellor: The Holy Handwashing"

flavor_hes.7.desc: "As the terrifying new pestilence sweeps through [GetCountry('HES').GetName], the population has grown desperate for any form of protection. Seeking spiritual solace, [GetCharacter('gottfried_von_beust').GetShortName] has begun instructing peasants and burghers to rigorously cleanse their hands with holy water before all daily activities and meals. While the population embraces this ritual purification with fervor, the local Clergy is outraged. They claim the widespread, mundane use of holy water desecrates the consecrated fluid and severely diminishes the Church's authority over solemn sacraments."

flavor_hes.7.historical_info: "The mid-14th century [ShowSituationName('black_death')] decimated Europe, but medieval medical understanding failed to grasp the role of hygiene in disease transmission. Ironically, forcing the population to wash their hands, even for purely ritualistic reasons, would have accidentally reduced the spread of bacterial and viral pathogens. This accidental public health benefit, driven by spiritual fear, would have provided a temporary, noticeable benefit to afflicted communities, while simultaneously causing friction with the clerical establishment over control of consecrated materials."

flavor_hes.7.a: "Support the new ritual; the population must be calmed."
flavor_hes.7.a.tt1: "The use of holy water is widespread and popular among the population, providing a temporary boost to public health and stability during the [ShowSituationName('black_death')]."
flavor_hes.7.b: "The use of holy water must remain sacred."

flavor_hes.8.title: "The Iron Chancellor: Salvation"

flavor_hes.8.desc: "The Landgrave's decision regarding the use of holy water has ignited a storm of controversy. The powerful clerical hierarchy, incensed by the perceived desecration of a sacrament, has targeted [GetCharacter('gottfried_von_beust').GetShortName]. The Church insists that his actions have rendered him unfit for service and that he must be permanently removed from the Landgrave's court. We must choose between protecting our loyal Chancellor and avoiding a potentially catastrophic schism with the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')]."

flavor_hes.8.historical_info: "Medieval politics frequently saw high-ranking administrators caught between the secular needs of the prince and the powerful privileges of the Church, particularly if the administrator was a cleric himself. Such officials, like [GetCharacter('gottfried_von_beust').GetLastName], often served as lightning rods for opposition, and their fate frequently determined the political alignment of the ruler. Landgraves could rarely afford open, protracted feuds with the ecclesiastical power structure."

# Option A: Protect the Chancellor (Kick him from the Clergy Estate, keep him as a character, punish the Clergy)
# This path implies von Beust is stripped of his clerical status but retains loyalty to the Crown.
flavor_hes.8.a: "[GetCharacter('gottfried_von_beust').GetShortName] is loyal to the Crown!"
flavor_hes.8.a.tt1: "Should [gottfried_von_beust.GetShortName] continue to live, they will #g significantly#! exploit the estates after the [ShowSituationName('black_death')]. "

# Option B: Sacrifice the Chancellor (Execute him, satisfy the Clergy, lose the powerful character)
flavor_hes.8.b: "The political cost is too high. Deliver [GetCharacter('gottfried_von_beust').GetShortName] to the gallows."
flavor_hes.8.b.tt1: "[gottfried_von_beust.GetShortName] will not reduce the power of the estates."

With vast amounts of land unworked and fewer hands available, estate holdings are temporarily diminished. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetShortName], empowered by the administrative groundwork of officials like [gottfried_von_beust.GetShortName], can now move decisively. By standardizing law and centralizing tax records now, we can seize this momentary crisis to establish a new, durable norm of Crown authority over local [privileges_with_icon|e]."

flavor_hes.9.historical_info: "The [ShowSituationName('black_death')] created severe labor shortages across [ShowContinentName('europe')] (c. 1347-1351), temporarily shifting power away from landholders toward the centralized territorial princes. Landgraves who capitalized on this period were able to enforce standardization, secure better control over feudal taxation, and limit the ability of the Nobility and Clergy to maintain their traditional independent rights."

To secure its future and ensure its proper maintenance as a site of international importance, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetShortName] must formally establish a permanent, specialized administration. The [GetCountry('TEU').GetLongName] already serve as the guardian of the site, and with a royal decree, have agreed to fund it's construction. While this guarantees the church's magnificence, it establishes a powerful foreign entity right in the heart of [GetCountry('HES').GetName]."

flavor_hes.10.historical_info: "The site of Saint Elizabeth of [GetCountry('HUN').GetName] in [ShowLocationName('marburg')], consecrated in 1283, was eventually the first truly Gothic church built in the German-speaking territories. Its construction and the maintenance of the saint's shrine were granted to [GetCountry('TEU').GetName] in 1318.

flavor_hes.11.historical_info: "While the Teutonic Order was initially entitled to the shrine of St. Elizabeth, their presence evolved into an aggressive 'state within a state.' By the mid-14th century, the Order frequently used its military prestige and international wealth to bully local rulers into granting them autonomous jurisdictions. Standing against the Order was a high-stakes act of resistance; it meant challenging a powerful military-religious organization that could rally the Pope and the Emperor against any Landgrave bold enough to seize their 'sacred' holdings."

flavor_hes.16.desc: "To transform our scattered estates into a true state, we must physically carve our borders into the earth. By constructing the Landgraben, we can construct a massive network of ditches and impenetrable hornbeam hedges, funneling trade through our checkpoints and stifle the independence of the local nobility."
flavor_hes.16.historical_info: "Under Landgrave Hermann II (r. 1376-1413), [GetCountry('HES').GetName] began the systematic construction of the Landgraben. These were not just military defenses, but administrative tools used to define the borders against the fragmented holdings of the Knights' societies, such as the Sternerbund, who viewed these hedges as a direct threat to their feudal freedom."

We shall expand the state using urban gold, effectively using one estate to dismantle the other."

flavor_hes.17.a: "Squeeze the cities to buy the land."
flavor_hes.17.b: "The burden on the estates is too great."
flavor_hes.17.historical_info: "In the 15th century, the Hessian Landgraves frequently used the Landbede, a territorial tax, to target the wealth of towns like Kassel and Marburg. This liquidity allowed the Crown to foreclose on the debts of the Ritterschaft. This strategy successfully unified the territory but led to deep-seated resentment in the urban councils, who felt they were being used as the Crown's private bank."

Known for his tactical brilliance in small-scale warfare and sieges, he was a key figure in the Mainz Diocesan Feud.

flavor_hes.21.historical_info: "Currency fraud by rulers was a serious violation of medieval and early modern law, often leading to revolts and diplomatic crises.
